				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="color: #141823;">Wo kata&#8230;..many of our celebs must have shouted like this in their younger years when Makar Sankrati was all about flying kites, special Til ke Laddoo from Mom&#8217;s kitchen and lip smacking meal. We bring few celebs experience from memory lane. Let&#8217;s check what they have to share.</span></p>
<p><strong><em><span style="color: #222222;">Nandish Sandhu: <a href="http://www.just-showbiz.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Nandish-New2.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-20144" src="http://www.just-showbiz.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Nandish-New2.jpg" alt="Nandish New2" width="3840" height="4990" /></a></span></em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em><span style="color: #222222;"><span style="font-weight: normal; font-style: normal;">Makar Sankranti used be like this huge festival in Rajasthan. We used to celebrate Lohri and Makar Sankranti both with so much enthusiasm. I remember dad getting Gajak, Revdi and Til Barfi and mom used to make Til ladoo, pheeni and gajar Ka halwa. The fridge used to be filled with sweets. </span><span style="font-weight: normal; font-style: normal;">I remember mom giving small gifts to newly married couples. </span><span style="font-weight: normal; font-style: normal;">In the evening we had a huge bonfire where all friends and family would gather and sing songs.</span><br style="font-weight: normal; font-style: normal;" /><span style="font-weight: normal; font-style: normal;">To keep the tradition going this year I&#8217;ve brought Revdi and will have some sweet cooked with jaggery for friends and family and have a small family dinner at home. Making a small donation from mom&#8217;s side for some girls education.</span></span></em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em><span style="color: #222222;">Anuj Sachdeva:<a href="http://www.just-showbiz.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/image_2.jpeg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-20143" src="http://www.just-showbiz.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/image_2.jpeg" alt="image_2" width="1536" height="2304" /></a></span></em></strong></p>
<p><span style="color: #222222;">My kite flying memories are from my delhi days when I would enjoy the festival with friends and family. The best memory is every year going to the temple on the day and distributing and donating food to the needy. My mom reminds me to do this every year </span><span style="color: #222222;">And I feel it&#8217;s a good habit. And yes she makes sure that we are complete vegetarians and don&#8217;t have eggs even on this auspicious day.</span></p>
<p><strong><em><span style="color: #222222;">Shantanu Maheshwari: <a href="http://www.just-showbiz.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Shantanu3.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-20146" src="http://www.just-showbiz.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Shantanu3.jpg" alt="Shantanu3" width="2848" height="4272" /></a></span></em></strong><br style="color: #222222;" /><span style="color: #222222;">When I was small all I used to do was see my brothers fly kites &amp; I use to request them to allow me to hold the latie, coz by doing that I use to feel I will at least be involved in the process of kite flying &#8230;&amp; </span><span style="color: #222222;">Use to enjoy doing this. </span><span style="color: #222222;">Now I have kind of stopped flying kites coz it proves fatal to animals specially birds &amp; I don&#8217;t like that &#8230; Its risky for motorists also .. So I kind of gradually stopped celebrating makar sankranti by kite flying instead I eat good food.</span></p>
<p><strong><em><span style="color: #222222;">Shubhangi Latkar:<a href="http://www.just-showbiz.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Shubhangi1.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-20147" src="http://www.just-showbiz.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Shubhangi1.jpg" alt="Shubhangi1" width="1416" height="2000" /></a></span></em></strong></p>
<p><span style="color: #222222;"> I remember this festival from the days of the 1st year of my marriage when my mother in law bought beautiful black sarre that year for me.  It was with so much love and care and respect.  This year the climate is really pleasant to enjoy the festival along with sweets made of feel and gaggery.  </span></p>
<p><br style="color: #222222;" /><strong><em><span style="color: #222222;">Rohan Mehra:<a href="http://www.just-showbiz.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/photo-3.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-20145" src="http://www.just-showbiz.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/photo-3.jpg" alt="photo 3" width="1365" height="2048" /></a></span></em></strong></p>

<p><span style="color: #222222;">It is said that all good things must come to an end. After </span><span style="color: #222222;">entertaining viewers over a span of more than 6 years, <strong><em>COLORS&#8217;</em></strong>  </span><span style="color: #222222;">flagship show, Uttaran is drawing its curtains today. Today last episode of <strong><em>Uttran</em> </strong>will be telecasted.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #222222;">The show, which  kicked off as a journey of two friends, <strong><em>Ichcha and </em></strong></span><span style="color: #222222;"><strong><em>Tapasya</em></strong> belonging to two different socio-economic classes of the </span><span style="color: #222222;">society raked in some strong feedback from the viewers which made it </span><span style="color: #222222;">one of the top-rated shows on Indian television. Even now, as the </span><span style="color: #222222;">show&#8217;s closure is imminent, Uttaran will always be remembered as one </span><span style="color: #222222;">of the most phenomenal shows in the television industry which has had </span><span style="color: #222222;">a positive impact on the lives of its artists and viewers.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #222222;">Today, the story of Uttaran has come a full circle with the journey </span><span style="color: #222222;">reaching a junction which concentrates on<strong><em> Meethi and Mukta</em></strong>&#8216;s equation </span><span style="color: #222222;">the young daughters of Ichcha and Tapasya. Reminiscing their times </span><span style="color: #222222;">spent during the shoot, the actors &#8211; who have contributed towards </span><span style="color: #222222;">making Uttaran a truly sensational television offering &#8211; have been </span><span style="color: #222222;"> reliving some of their most cherished moments from the years gone by.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #222222;"><strong><em>Tina Dutta</em></strong>, whose has portrayed a wide range of characters on the show </span><span style="color: #222222;">and today, essays the role of Meethi on the show, exclaims, <em>&#8220;My</em></span><em><span style="color: #222222;"> experience of working on Uttaran can only be described as awesome!</span><span style="color: #222222;"> Uttaran was my debut in a lead role on television because of which the </span><span style="color: #222222;">show will always remain very close to my heart. Not only have I learnt </span><span style="color: #222222;"> a lot from all the senior actors that I have worked with, but I have </span><span style="color: #222222;">also grown as a professional in many ways.&#8221; When further quizzed about </span><span style="color: #222222;">what she will miss most about the show, Tina is quick to respond, </span><span style="color: #222222;">&#8220;Undoubtedly, I will miss all the fun that I have with my costars &#8211; </span><span style="color: #222222;">especially Mrunal (Akash), Sreejita (Mukta). Pratima Ma&#8217;am (Nani) and </span><span style="color: #222222;">the entire team of the show.&#8221;</span></em></p>
<p><span style="color: #222222;"><strong><em>Sreejita De</em></strong>, who essays the role of Mukta in the show, looks back at </span><span style="color: #222222;">her Uttaran days fondly. She said,<strong><em> &#8220;</em></strong><em>Every day has been a fresh memory </em></span><em><span style="color: #222222;">while working on Uttaran. But yes, if there is one particular day I </span><span style="color: #222222;">remember vividly, it has to be my first day on the shoot when I met </span><span style="color: #222222;">the cast and crew of the show! The team welcomed me with open arms and </span><span style="color: #222222;">there has been no looking back for me since then. I will miss meeting </span><span style="color: #222222;">everyone on a daily basis.&#8221;</span></em></p>
<p><span style="color: #222222;">Admitting that the news of Uttaran coming to an end has made him enjoy </span><span style="color: #222222;">the small moments more than ever before,<strong><em> Mrunal Jain</em></strong> who portrays the </span><span style="color: #222222;">role of Akash on the show says,  <em>&#8220;During my Uttaran stint, I bonded</em></span><em><span style="color: #222222;"> with my cast and crew like a family. We have spent more than 10 hours </span><span style="color: #222222;"> together on a daily basis and it was natural for us to foster the</span></em><span style="color: #222222;"><em> strong relationships that we have</em>. Speaking about how they all love to</span><span style="color: #222222;"> work as a unit, Mrunal further adds, <em>&#8220;I love it when our producers </em></span><em><span style="color: #222222;">come over for lunch every day. We are going to work on New Year&#8217;s Eve </span><span style="color: #222222;">as well as  1st January and ring in the New Year on the set!&#8221;Signing </span><span style="color: #222222;">off with a vote of thanks for his fans, Mrunal concludes saying, &#8220;It&#8217;s</span><span style="color: #222222;"> because of the love that our fans have showered on us that we have</span><span style="color: #222222;"> been able to complete these 6 years successfully. I want our fans to</span><span style="color: #222222;"> know that we will always be around to entertain them especially</span><span style="color: #222222;"> because their support has helped us reach where we are today!&#8221;</span></em></p>
<p><span style="color: #222222;"><strong><em>Rashami Desai</em></strong>, who has been an integral part of Uttaran through its </span><span style="color: #222222;">various phases, summarizes her journey with Uttaran by saying, <em>&#8220;My</em></span><em><span style="color: #222222;"> journey in Uttaran has been exceptionally memorable. The show has</span><span style="color: #222222;"> allowed me to grow as an actor. Having portrayed the various roles of</span><span style="color: #222222;"> Tapasya &#8211; the daughter, the wife and the mother &#8211; has helped me gain</span><span style="color: #222222;"> more perspective as a professional. Of course, the bond between</span><span style="color: #222222;"> Tapasya and Ichcha has been etched in the history of Hindi GEC shows.</span><span style="color: #222222;"> I am grateful to my fans and viewers who have given me a popular</span><span style="color: #222222;"> status in spite of Tapasya&#8217;s grey character. Looking back, I feel </span><span style="color: #222222;">overwhelmed at how the show never let the ball drop and kept the </span><span style="color: #222222;">momentum going.&#8221;</span></em></p>
<p><span style="color: #222222;">Talking about his special association with Uttaran, <strong><em>Gaurav Chopraa</em></strong></span><span style="color: #222222;"> said<em> &#8220;Uttaran is the show with which I have been associated for the</em></span><em><span style="color: #222222;"> longest time.  Through the show, I have experienced a journey that I</span><span style="color: #222222;"> will never forget because it has taught me many things. It has been a</span><span style="color: #222222;"> legend in the world of television not only because of its long run but</span><span style="color: #222222;"> also because of the kind of adulation it has received consistently</span><span style="color: #222222;"> from the audience. Uttaran, I believe, is more popular than most shows</span><span style="color: #222222;"> on television today and that is something which cannot be gauged</span><span style="color: #222222;"> through the show&#8217;s ratings. It is a show whose actors will always be </span><span style="color: #222222;"> called by their character names. It is a show that has transcended </span><span style="color: #222222;">boundaries and countries.&#8221;</span></em><span style="color: #222222;">Sharing his fondest memories as Mr. Rathore<em>, Gaurav</em> further adds,</span><span style="color: #222222;"> <em>&#8220;Playing the role of Raghuvendra Pratap Rathore has taught me that</em></span><em><span style="color: #222222;"> respect for an actor is a far bigger achievement than stardom. It has</span><span style="color: #222222;"> also taught me how to co-exist in a space where everyone is famous. It</span><span style="color: #222222;"> is a show that you feel proud of when you walked on the streets</span><span style="color: #222222;"> because people reacted to your presence with that kind of infectious</span><span style="color: #222222;"> excitement. My experience on the show has led me to believe that there</span><span style="color: #222222;"> will always be a section of the audience who will call me Mr. Rathore</span><span style="color: #222222;"> and I would like to thank COLORS for giving me this show as the</span><span style="color: #222222;"> perfect platform to connect with my fans.&#8221;</span></em></p>
<p><span style="color: #222222;">A show which is still creating conversations amongst its viewers,</span><span style="color: #222222;"> Uttaran, will draw to a close today. The show will</span><span style="color: #222222;"> surely be missed by not only the show&#8217;s fans, but also by the entire</span><span style="color: #222222;"> team that has strived hard to make this show television&#8217;s hottest</span><span style="color: #222222;"> property for the 6 years that it has aired on COLORS!</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #222222;">To watch Meethi and Mukta&#8217;s sojourn reach a happy ending, don&#8217;t miss</span><span style="color: #222222;"> Uttaran as it enters its last segment today only on COLORS!</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #222222;"> 9 Oscar nominated and Golden Globe winning Birdman starring Michael Keaton as a former superhero-playing actor trying to recharge his career with a Broadway play is all set to release in theatres on </span><span class="aBn" style="color: #222222;" tabindex="0" data-term="goog_738981418"><span class="aQJ">30th January</span></span><span style="color: #222222;">!</span></p>

Keaton plays a faded Hollywood actor famous for his superhero role struggling to mount a Broadway adaptation of a Raymond Carver story.</span><br style="color: #222222;" /><br style="color: #222222;" /><span style="color: #222222;"> What’s interesting is that the movie looks like it was filmed in one take due to some judicious camera cuts. Though the director wanted to film in one take it didn’t happen because apparently Emma Stone kept screwing up the movie according to the actress!!</span><br style="color: #222222;" /><br style="color: #222222;" /><span style="color: #222222;">“It was hard. It was definitely hard,” Stone told about Iñárritu’s unique technique. “And I screwed it up, quite a few times. And I was just so sick to my stomach, waiting for them to do the scene, hearing how good this take was going to be and then coming in, and going around the corner too fast and ruining it. Alejandro goes, ‘You’re ruining the movie!’ and then you go, ‘Oh, my god,’ ” Stone said laughing. </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><br style="color: #222222;" /><span style="color: #222222;">Catch the hugely anticipated movie on </span><span class="aBn" style="color: #222222;" tabindex="0" data-term="goog_738981419"><span class="aQJ">30th January</span></span><span style="color: #222222;">!!</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After the much talked about dance in<strong><em> Jumme Ki Raat,</em></strong> Jacqueline Fernandez has become a favourite with all choreographers and directors to make her dance in every film. With her next film <strong><em>ROY</em></strong>,<strong><em> Jacqueline Fernandez</em></strong> has tried a completely different style of contemporary dance form, a ballet on sand for the next song <strong><em>Boond Boond.</em></strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.just-showbiz.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/PE1A5498.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-20350" src="http://www.just-showbiz.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/PE1A5498.jpg" alt="PE1A5498" width="3840" height="2560" /></a></p>
<p>The director Vikramjit Singh wanted a sequence in the song which is artistic, sensual and passionate. When he briefed Ahmed Khan, Ahmed instantly knew what he wanted to do. Jacqueline who did wonders with Ahmed in their last song Jumme Ki Raat has tried the dance style for the first time. Choreographed by Ahmed Khan, Jacqueline will be the first Hindi actress to try this form of dancing in ROY which is a romantic thriller.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.just-showbiz.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/PE1A4593.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-20351" src="http://www.just-showbiz.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/PE1A4593.jpg" alt="PE1A4593" width="2880" height="1920" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Speaking about it, Jacqueline says, <strong><em>“Ahmed gave me a couple of videos to watch to understand the body language and refer to before the shoot. He is one of the finest choreographer who loves experimenting and is passionate about his work.” While on set, all the rehearsal was at test as it turned very difficult to dance on the sand, as her toes went sinking in.  </em></strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.just-showbiz.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/PE1A4614.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-20352" src="http://www.just-showbiz.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/PE1A4614.jpg" alt="PE1A4614" width="2880" height="1920" /></a></p>
<p>Jacqueline who loves dancing suggested some moves to Ahmed who loved them and incorporated the same while on shoot. Jacqueline adds, <strong><em>“Ahmed gave a completely different, fresh touch to the kind of ballet we have always seen on screen. I too had ideas and together we put a piece together. The final scene that you see on screen is sensuous and passionate.”</em></strong></p>
