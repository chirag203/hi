<p>The whole fiasco will also work in favour of Leeladhar for getting Radha’s attention as he will be the one to save Radha after her brave attempt, where she wears a red sari to get the cow’s notice to distract it from the children.</p>
<p>Hope this incident will bring the couple closer and Radha will understand Leeladhar’s worth.</p>
