<p><strong>Rashmi Sharma</strong> Productions will be making a long running typical desi masala soap for <strong>Zee TV</strong> channel and we hear the show is in its budding stages, and the casting process is presently on.<br />
But seems like the main lead has already been decided and its none other than <strong>Harshad Arora</strong> of <strong>Beintehaa</strong> fame, who will grace our TV screens in a contrasting character when compared to his role of <em>Zain</em> in Beintehaa.<br />
And buzz also is that the female lead has also been decided, <strong>Shiny Doshi,</strong> who essayed the role of Kumud’s sister, <em>Kusum</em> in Saraswatichandra. Though the beautiful actor remained out of reach for any comment.<br />
As for Harshad, he said <em><strong>“Yes, talks are certainly on. All I want to tell you now is that this will be a very different character, totally unlike Zain and Harshad. If I get this, it will be a new challenge in terms of the role for me.”</strong></em><br />
From the sources we cam to know that the lead cast has been locked, and the pilot for the show will be shot soon. The show is expected to roll fast, as the channel is readying few new launches in the first quarter of the year.<br />
Well we are waiting for the charming pair to cast their spell on us through this new show, what say readers?</p>
